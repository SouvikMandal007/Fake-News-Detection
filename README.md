# Fake-News-Detection
Overview
This project classifies news as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It preprocesses text, converts it into numerical vectors, and trains models for accurate detection.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, removing stopwords, and text vectorization using TF-IDF.

Model Training & Evaluation: Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier, achieving 99% accuracy.

Visualization: Used WordCloud and Confusion Matrix for insights.

Tech Stack
ðŸ”¹ Python | Pandas | NLTK | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib

Results
âœ… Logistic Regression: 98.9% Accuracy
âœ… Decision Tree: 99.5% Accuracy
